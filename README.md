# Humor do Dia

A simple React app to track and share your daily mood, with special surprises for coworkers and your husband.

## Features

- Enter your name and mood (1-10) for the day.
- See a random emoji based on your mood.
- Special GIFs and messages for:
  - **Coworkers**: Enter a name from the coworkers list to see a unique GIF.
  - **Husband**: Enter your husbandâ€™s name or nickname for hearts and a special GIF.

## Special Data

The app uses `appData.js` to manage special names and their GIFs:

- **Coworkers**: Names in the `coworkers` array trigger a unique GIF from `coworkerGifs`.
- **Husband**: Names in the `husband` array trigger hearts and a GIF from `husbandGifs`.

You can customize these arrays and GIF URLs in `src/app/appData.js`.
